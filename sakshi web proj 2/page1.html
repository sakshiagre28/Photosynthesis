            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun is the inexhaustible source of energy for earth. The chlorophyll containing  organisms are able to absob the solar energy and convert it into chemical energy in the form of food. This is essentially a mechanism of energy input in the living world which is known as photosynthesis.</p><br>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photosynthesis is defined as an intracellular, anabolic process in which glucose is synthesized using simple inorganic substances like CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O as a raw material, in the presence of light and chlorophyll-a and with release of oxygen as a by-product. The overall equation of photosynthesis is,<br><br><br>

            <h2>Autotrophic Nutrition:</h2><br>
            
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autotrophic nutrition is a process where the organism prepares their food from the simple inorganic materials like water, mineral salts and carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight. All the green plants possess an autotrophic mode of nutrition.
            The autotrophic organisms contain a green colored pigment called chlorophyll which helps in trapping energy from the sun. They prepare their own food by utilizing the trapped solar energy, water, and carbon dioxide by the process of photosynthesis. This results in forming of glucose.Like plants, blue-green algae and cyanobacteria could be considered as the group member into autotrophic nutrition.</p>

            <h2>Early experiments:</h2><br>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, it was believed that during photosynthesis CO<sub>2</sub> splits into carbon and O<sub>2</sub>.Carbon combines with H<sub>2</sub>O to form glucose and O<sub>2</sub> is released as by-product.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4 id="reaction1"> <b>CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O------>(CH<sub>2</sub>O)+O<sub>2</sub></b></h4><br><br>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Hill(1937) found that isolated chloroplasts from plants can release oxygen when they are illuminated by sunlight in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor such as ferricyanide. To demonstrate the Hill reaction in the laboratory dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) was used as the terminal electron acceptor, replacing NADP which was not available due to the extraction of the chloroplasts from the plant cellular environment. The ferrocyanide is reduced (just as NADP is when the chloroplast is in vivo) while water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is oxidized into oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen cations during the reaction. By using this technique to observe the reaction, Hill revealed a variety of valuable facts about photosynthesis. The Hill reaction confirms that oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is produced by a reaction that is separate from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation. The reaction in which oxygen is released requires light; therefore the Hill reaction can be described as the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis. The reaction in which oxygen is released takes place within the chloroplast of plants and the Hill reaction demonstrated that the release of oxygen is only a partial reaction which requires one step of photosynthesis.</p><p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hill reaction implies that the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis is a result of a series of redox reactions and a suitable terminal electron acceptor is required for that reaction to occur. Plants have natural electron acceptors such as NADP, that play a major role in the oxidation of water.</p>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photosynthesis is the process in which light energy is absorbed and converted to chemical energy. This chemical energy is eventually used in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to sugar (CH<sub>2</sub>O) in plants. During the process of photosynthesis, a natural electron acceptor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), is reduced in chloroplasts to NADPH. Overall within a chloroplast, the following equilibrium reaction takes place.</p><br><br>

            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oxidation reaction as NADPH's energy is used elsewhere:</p><br><br>

            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferredoxin, also known as a NADH+ reductase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction reaction. It is easy to oxidize NADPH but difficult to reduce NADP+, hence a catalyst is involved. Cytochromes are conjugate proteins that contain a haem group.The iron atom from this haem group undergoes redox reactions:</p><br><br>
