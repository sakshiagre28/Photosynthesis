            <li>Photosynthesis is a source of all our food and fuel. It is the only biological process that acts as the driving vital force for the whole animal kingdom and for the non-photosynthetic organism.</li>
        
            <li>It drives all other processes of biological and abiological world. It is responsible for the growth and sustenance of our biosphere.</li>
            
            <li>It provides organic substances, which are used in the production of fats, proteins, nucleoproteins, pigments, enzymes, vitamins, cellulose, organic acids, etc. Some of them become structural parts of the organisms.</li>

            <li>It makes use of simple raw materials such as CO2, H2O and inexhaustible light energy for the synthesis of energetic organic compounds.</li>

            <li>It is significant because it provides energy in terms of fossil fuels like coal and petrol obtained from plants, which lived millions and millions of years ago.</li>

            <li>Plants, from great trees to microscopic algae, are engaged in converting light energy into chemical energy, while man with all his knowledge in chemistry and physics cannot imitate them.
