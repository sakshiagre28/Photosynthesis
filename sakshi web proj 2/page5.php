            <h2>Calvin Cycle(C<sub>3</sub> pathway):</h2>
           
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cycle was discovered in 1950 by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley. They used radioactive carbon-14 to trace the path of carbon atoms in carbon fixation.The set of reactions also is known as the dark reactions, C3 cycle, Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, or reductive pentose phosphate cycle. Calvin cycle consists of three steps:</p><br>
            <div id="box1"><h3>1.Carbon Fixation:</h3>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carbon fixation, a CO2 molecule from the atmosphere combines with a five-carbon acceptor molecule called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP).

The resulting six-carbon compound is then split into two molecules of the three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA).

This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase, also known as RuBisCO. Due to the key role it plays in photosynthesis, RuBisCo is probably the most abundant enzyme on Earth.</p>

            <div id="box2"><h3>2.Reduction:</h3>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second stage of the Calvin cycle, the 3-PGA molecules created through carbon fixation are converted into molecules of a simple sugar – glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate (G3P).

This stage uses energy from ATP and NADPH created in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In this way, the Calvin cycle becomes the way in which plants convert energy from sunlight into long-term storage molecules, such as sugars. The energy from the ATP and NADPH is transferred to the sugars.

This step is called “reduction” because NADPH donates electrons to the 3-phosphoglyceric acid molecules to create glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate. In chemistry, the process of donating electrons is called “reduction,” while the process of taking electrons is called “oxidation.”</p>

        <div id="box3">
            <h3>3.Regeneration:</h3>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate molecules go to make glucose, while others must be recycled to regenerate the five-carbon RuBP compound that is used to accept new carbon molecules.

The regeneration process requires ATP. It is a complex process involving many steps.

Because it takes six carbon molecules to make a glucose, this cycle must be repeated six times to make a single molecule of glucose.

To accomplish this equation, five out of six glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate molecules that are created through the Calvin cycle are regenerated to form RuBP molecules. The sixth exits the cycle to become one half of a glucose molecule.</p>

        <h2>C<sub>4</sub> Pathway:</h2><br>
        <div>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C4 carbon fixation or the Hatch-Slack pathway is a photosynthetic process in some plants. It is the first step in extracting carbon from carbon dioxide to be able to use it in sugar and other biomolecules. It is one of three known processes for carbon fixation. The C4 in one of the names refers to the 4-carbon molecule that is the first product of this type of carbon fixation.
                <img id="pic3" src="c4%20pathway.png" title="C-4 Pathway">
C4 fixation is an elaboration of the more common C3 carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently. C4 overcomes the tendency of the enzyme RuBisCO to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in the process of photorespiration. This is achieved by ensuring that RuBisCO works in an environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen. CO2 is shuttled via malate or aspartate from mesophyll cells to bundle-sheath cells. In these bundle-sheath cells CO<sub>2</sub> is released by decarboxylation of the malate. C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to capture more CO<sub>2</sub> in the mesophyll cells. PEP Carboxylase (3 carbons) binds to CO2 to make oxaloacetic acid (OAA). The OAA then makes malate (4 carbons). Malate enters bundle sheath cells and releases the CO<sub>2</sub>. These additional steps, however, require more energy in the form of ATP. Using this extra energy, C4 plants are able to more efficiently fix carbon in drought, high temperatures, and limitations of nitrogen or CO2. Since the more common C3 pathway does not require this extra energy, it is more efficient in the other conditions.

The naming Hatch-Slack pathway is in honor of Marshall Davidson Hatch and C. R. Slack, who elucidated it in Australia in 1966.</p>
