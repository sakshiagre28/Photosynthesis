            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. It involves photophosphorylation and photolysis of water leading to formation NADPH<sub>2</sub> and liberation of O<sub>2</sub>. </p><br><br>
            <h2>Photophosphorylation:</h2><br>
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of photosynthesis, the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP using the energy of sunlight is called photophosphorylation. Dr. Arnon suggested that synthesis of ATP takes place by cyclic and non-cyclic ways. Therefore, there are two types of photophosphorylation: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1)Non- cyclic photophosphorylation</b><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2)Cyclic photophosphorylation</b></p>

            <h2>Non- cyclic photophosphorylation:</h2><br>
            <img id="pic1" src="non-cyclic-photophosphorylation.PNG" title="Non-cyclic photophosphorylation"><br>

            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pathway, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, is a two-stage process involving two different chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic photophosphorylation occurs in the frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into <b>2H<sup>+</sup> + 1/2 O<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup></b> by a process called photolysis (or light-splitting). The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in <b>photosystem II</b>, while the 2H<sup>+</sup> and 1/2O<sub>2</sub> are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction core center of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy to the core of <b>photosystem II</b>, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to plastoquinone, which takes the <b>2e<sup>-</sup></b> from Pheophytin, and two <b>H<sup>+</sup></b> atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two <b>H<sup>+</sup></b> ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the <b>Cyt b6</b> and <b>Cyt f</b>. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) to be pumped into the thylakoid space. This creates a gradient, making H<sup>+</sup> ions flow back into the stroma of the chloroplast, providing the energy for the regeneration of ATP.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>photosystem II</b> complex replaced its lost electrons from an external source; however, the two other electrons are not returned to photosystem II as they would in the analogous cyclic pathway. Instead, the still-excited electrons are transferred to a <b>photosystem I</b> complex, which boosts their energy level to a higher level using a second solar photon. The highly excited electrons are transferred to the acceptor molecule, but this time are passed on to an enzyme called <b>Ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup></b> reductase which uses them to catalyse the reaction (as shown):<br><br>

           <p class="para"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This consumes the H<sup>+</sup> ions produced by the splitting of water, leading to a net production of 1/2 O<sub>2</sub>, ATP, and NADPH+H<sup>+</sup> with the consumption of solar photons and water.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concentration of NADPH in the chloroplast may help regulate which pathway electrons take through the light reactions. When the chloroplast runs low on ATP for the Calvin cycle, NADPH will accumulate and the plant may shift from noncyclic to cyclic electron flow.</p>

        <h2>2)Cyclic Photophosphorylation:</h2>
            <p class="para"><img id="pic2" src="cyclic-phosphorylation.png" title="Cyclic Photophosphorylation"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of photophosphorylation occurs on the thylakoid membrane. In cyclic electron flow, the electron begins in a pigment complex called photosystem I, passes from the primary acceptor to plastoquinone, then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before returning to chlorophyll. This transport chain produces a proton-motive force, pumping H+ ions across the membrane; this produces a concentration gradient that can be used to power ATP synthase during chemiosmosis. This pathway is known as cyclic photophosphorylation, and it produces neither O2 nor NADPH. Unlike non-cyclic photophosphorylation, NADP+ does not accept the electrons; they are instead sent back to phytochrome b6f complex.<br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bacterial photosynthesis, a single photosystem is used, and therefore is involved in cyclic photophosphorylation. It is favored in anaerobic conditions and conditions of high irradiance and CO2 compensation points.</p><br><br>

                <h2>Chemiosmotic hypothesis(proton pump):</h2><br>
                <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemisosmotic hypothesis first postulated by Peter Mitchell in 1961 describes the process of ATP generation in the final stage of cellular respiration, namely oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. This process was also discovered to take place in the thylakoids of chloroplasts as a means of generating ATP and reduced NADP in the light dependent reaction, key products needed for the light independent reaction to generate hexose sugars in plants. Chemiosmosis in both plants and animals are essentially the same however there are a few subtleties in the creation of the proton gradient related to the electron transport chain.</p></div><br>

                <div id="back4"><p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemiosmotic hypothesis suggests that the action of ATP synthase is coupled with that of a proton gradient. It is the action of the proton gradient that causes a proton motive force that allows ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP and inorganic phosphate to ATP. In mitochondria, the key site of ATP production in oxidative phosphorylation is the inner mitochondrial membrane. Pumping of hydrogen ions to generate a gradient is facilitated by transmembranal proteins called electron carriers. These electron carriers are sites of redox reactions for electrons and with each reaction across the electron carriers the electrons energy is transferred into the pumping of hydrogen ions across the membrane.</p>

                <div id="back5"> <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This results in a high concentration in the intermembranal space than that of the matrix.The protons go through the ATPsynthase from an area of high concentration in the intermembranal space to an area of lower concentration, the mitochondrial matrix, through facilitated diffusion generating ATP. The proton-motive force is the mathematical sum of the chemical gradient, expressed as the difference in pH between the matrix and intermembranal space, and the charge gradient created by the disequilibrium (via proton pumping) of proton distribution either side of the inner membrane.</p>
