        <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main role of chloroplasts is to conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including fatty acid synthesis, much amino acid synthesis, and the immune response in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat.</p><br>
        
            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloroplasts are generally lens-shaped, 3–10 μm in diameter and 1–3 μm thick.All chloroplasts have at least three membrane systems—the outer chloroplast membrane, the inner chloroplast membrane, and the thylakoid system.The outer and inner membrane is collectively called peristromium.The protein-rich, alkaline, aqueous fluid within the inner chloroplast membrane and outside of the thylakoid space is called the stroma which contains enzymes for reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm).DNA is circular, closed, naked ring and is called plastidome. Chloroplast is self-replicating and semi-autonomous cell organelle.</p><br>

            <p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 40-60 green coloured structures called grana embedded in the stroma. Grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Photosynthetic pigments are embedded in thylakoids. Grana are interconnected by membranes called stroma-lamallae or fret-membranes or intergrana. They help in rapid transport of materials.</p><br><br>

            <p id="fact"><b>The origin of chloroplasts is best explained by the endosymbiotic theory. According to this theory, chloroplasts were originally cells and not mere cell organelles as they are today. They resembled bacterial cells like those of cyanobacteria, complete with genetic material (DNA) and formed a symbiotic relationship with plant cells. However, with time, the photosynthetic bacterial cells got engulfed by the host plant cells and formed the chloroplasts of today.</b></p><br><br>
